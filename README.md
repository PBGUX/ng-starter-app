from the project root. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.

## If you do not yet have a Node development environment set up:

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for your platform, version 12.18.1 or higher, Node Package Manager, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), will also be installed.(**Note:** we also recommend using Node Version Manager, [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) )

Install Angular CLI globally by running

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

Refer to the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) documentation for detailed information, including the [wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki).

Optionally, install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for your code editor.
